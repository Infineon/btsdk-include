 * Mesh provisioning is split into two parts.  The server side applies to all
 * devices and allows a provisioner to add this device to a mesh network.  It
 * is implemented in the Mesh application library so that each mesh application
 * can easily link this functionality in.  The client part is implemented in
 * the Mesh Provisioning library of the WICED SDK which provide a simple method for
 * an application to integrate functionality to add other devices to the
 * mesh network.
