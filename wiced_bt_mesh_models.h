 * 2. Each model consists of the model definition itself (company ID and model ID) and callback

 * use Mesh Library's callback.  In that case all validation of the messages, sending responses, and
 * other protocol requirements are executed by the model. Alternatively application can implement
 * callback itself. In that case, customer will be required to perform certification.

 *
 * The WICED Mesh OnOff Server module of the Mesh Models library provides a way to implement functionality for the
 * devices that can be controlled using a simple On/Off switch, aka On/Off client.
 *
 * The OnOff Server module is typically not used by a target applications. It is used by other modules that
 * extend OnOff functionality.  A simple example is a Power Plug application.  Instead of using OnOff module, the
 * application uses Power On/Off, which in addition to OnOff provides On Power Up behavior, i.e. the library
 * saves in the NVRAM configuration of the state required when device is powered up and controls application accordingly.
 * Similarly, an application  for dimmable light uses Light Lightness module.  If peer sends OnOff command, the application receives a
 * callback from the Light Lightness module that the lightness is set to zero.
 *
 * To use the OnOff Server, on startup an application or a module that extends the OnOff functionality should call
 * wiced_bt_mesh_model_onoff_server_init function providing the callback that will be executed when an OnOff request is received
 * to turn the device on or off.
 *
 * The module which extends OnOff server should call the wiced_bt_mesh_model_onoff_changed function when the OnOff state
 * of the device is changed locally.

 *
 * The WICED Mesh Level Server module of the Mesh Models library provides a way to implement functionality for the
 * devices that can be controlled using a simple level slider, aka Level client.
 *
 * The Level Server module is typically not used by a target applications. It is used by other modules that
 * extend Level functionality. For example a power adapter with controllable power level uses a Power Level
 * module which in addition to Level provides Power On/Off and On Power Up control.  Similarly,
 * an application for a dimmable light uses Light Lightness module.  While the client sends Level command,
 * the application receives callback from the Light Lightness module that the lightness is changed appropriately.
 *
 * To use the Level Server, on startup an application or a module that extends the Level functionality should call
 * @ref wiced_bt_mesh_model_level_server_init function providing the callback that will be executed when the change
 * of the level is requested.
 *
 * Note, that the Mesh Models library implements the transition state machine.  For example, when the change in
 * the level is requested over some transition time, the application will be called periodically while transition
 * is in progress.
 *
 * If the application initializes the Level server directly it should call @ref the wiced_bt_mesh_model_level_changed
 * function when the Level state of the device is changed locally.

 *
 * The WICED Mesh Level Client module of the Mesh Models library provides a way for an application to send Level
 * commands (set, delta and move) to the server and optionally receive status information. The module can be
 * used in an implementation of a simple slider device.
 *
 * To include Level functionality, the device description shall contain @ref WICED_BT_MESH_MODEL_LEVEL_CLIENT. To
 * implement a device which supports multiple sliders, the @ref WICED_BT_MESH_MODEL_LEVEL_CLIENT shall be included
 * in multiple elements. Based on this information, the device that performs configuration will be able to
 * specify different destination for different sliders supported by the device.
 *
 * There are three controlling methods which can be used depending on the application. The device which remembers its
 * state (for example, the current level), can use Level Set command.  The device which does not remember the state
 * but knows how much the level is being changed can use Delta Set command.  The device which can detect speed of the change
 * can use Move Set command.
 *
 * In a simplest form, an application needs to initialize using the @ref wiced_bt_mesh_model_level_client_init function
 * and then call @ref wiced_bt_mesh_model_level_client_set to tell the Mesh Library to send a command. The configuration
 * of the destination address and security credential is done during the provisioning/configuration process and
 * the application does not need to worry about it.
 *
 * If an application needs more control of how messages are sent out, it can use @ref wiced_bt_mesh_model_level_client_send_get,
 * @ref wiced_bt_mesh_model_level_client_send_set, @ref wiced_bt_mesh_model_level_client_send_delta_set, or
 * @ref wiced_bt_mesh_model_level_client_send_move_set functions. These functions require to use the p_event parameter which
 * include among others address of the desgination, application key index, retrnansmission parameters, TTL, and various others.
 * After creating the event, the application can adjust the paramters as needed.
 *
 * To receive Level Status information, an application during initialization specifies the callback that will
 * be executed when Level status message is received. The status information can be received as a result of sending
 * Level Get and Set commands.  In addition to that, the Level server can be configured to send the status information
 * to the device that implements the Level Client module, or to a group of the devices to which the OnOff Client belongs.

 *
 * The WICED Mesh Power Level Server module of the Mesh Models library provides a way to implement functionality of
 * a power plug type of a device that can be controlled using a Level slider (Generic Level client) and On/Off
 * switch (Generic On/Off client). In addition to that the device supports a default transition time server
 * functionality and the application can specify on power up behavior.
 *
 * To instantiate the Power Level Server module, that application includes the
 * @ref WICED_BT_MESH_MODEL_POWER_LEVEL_SERVER in the device definition. In addition to that, the application shall call
 * @ref wiced_bt_mesh_model_power_level_server_init function providing the @ref wiced_bt_mesh_power_level_server_callback_t
 * callback that will be executed when power level of the device needs to be changed.
 *
 * If the device supports several elements with the Power Level Server, for example a power strip with several power plugs, the @ref
 * WICED_BT_MESH_MODEL_POWER_LEVEL_SERVER shall be included for each element.

 *
 * The Mesh Power Level Server module in the Mesh Models library maintains the On/Off and Level states and notifies the
 * application on the state changes. The application shall call the @ref wiced_bt_mesh_model_power_level_server_level_changed function
 * when the power level of the device is changed locally.
 *
 * Most of the functionality of the Mesh Power Level server device is implemented in the Mesh Models Library. The
 * application only needs to set hardware appropriately on receiving @ref WICED_BT_MESH_POWER_LEVEL_SET event.
 * If client requests to change power to the target value over a period of time, the library will maintain the timer
 * and will periodically call the application with appropriate power level.
 *
 * The default transition time is managed by the Mesh Models library. The application provides factory default
 * in the default_transition_time element of the @ref wiced_bt_mesh_core_config_t configuration structure.
 * The default value is used unless overwritten by the default transition time client.
 *
 * The on power up behavior is managed by the Mesh Models library. The application provides factory default
 * in the onpowerup_state element of the @ref wiced_bt_mesh_core_config_t configuration structure.
 * The default value is used unless overwritten by the default transition time client.

 * @ingroup     wiced_bt_mesh_models
 *
 * The WICED Mesh Light Lightness Server module provides a way for an application to implement a dimmable light device which
 * can be controlled specifically by setting the brightness, but also can be can be controlled using a Level slider (Generic
 * Level client) and On/Off switch (Generic On/Off client). In addition to that the device supports a default transition time
 * server functionality and the application can specify on power up behavior.
 *
 * To include the Mesh Models support for the Light Lightness Server model the application includes @ref
 * WICED_BT_MESH_MODEL_LIGHT_LIGHTNESS_SERVER in the device definition. If the device supports several
 * elements with Light Lightness Server, for example, a light fixture or a chandelier with several dimmable
 * lights, the @ref WICED_BT_MESH_MODEL_LIGHT_LIGHTNESS_SERVER shall be included for each element.
 *
 * In addition to the definition, the application shall initialize the Light Lightness module by calling
 * @ref wiced_bt_mesh_model_light_lightness_server_init function for each element where the light dimming
 * functionality is required providing the @ref wiced_bt_mesh_light_lightness_server_callback_t
 * callback that will be executed when the brightness level of the device needs to be changed.
 *
 * Note: The Light Lightness module is used internally by the mesh models library in color light scenarios where
 * dimming is one of the methods controlling the light. In that case, the application shall not implicitely include
 * @ref WICED_BT_MESH_MODEL_LIGHT_LIGHTNESS_SERVER and shall not perform module initialization.
 *
 * While performing initialization the application provides the callback that will be executed when the library needs
 * to change the brightness of a light due to a request received over the mesh network, or due to the internal schedule.
 *
 * If brightness of the dimmable light is changed locally the application should call the
 * @ref wiced_bt_mesh_model_light_lightness_status_changed so that the library can maintain correct state and
 * send an appropriate status message if it is configured to do so.
 *
 * Most of the functionality of the Light Lightness server device is implemented in the Mesh Models Library. The
 * application only needs to set hardware appropriately on receiving @ref WICED_BT_MESH_LIGHT_LIGHTNESS_SET event.
 * If client requests to change the brightness to the target value over a period of time, the library will maintain
 * the timer and will periodically call the application with appropriate power level.
 *
 * The default transition time is managed by the Mesh Models library. The application provides factory default
 * in the default_transition_time element of the @ref wiced_bt_mesh_core_config_t configuration structure.
 * The default value is used unless overwritten by the default transition time client.
 *
 * The on power up behavior is managed by the Mesh Models library. The application provides factory default
 * in the onpowerup_state element of the @ref wiced_bt_mesh_core_config_t configuration structure.
 * The default value is used unless overwritten by the default transition time client.

 * device with color temperature support. The device can be controlled by setting the brightness, color temperature and delta UV,
 * but also can be can be controlled using a Level slider (Generic Level client) applied to the brightness or color
 * temperature and by a On/Off switch (Generic On/Off client). The device also supports a default transition time
 * server functionality and the application can specify on power up behavior.
 *
 * The definition of the CTL Server spans two elements. To include the Mesh Models support for the CTL Server model the
 * application includes @ref WICED_BT_MESH_MODEL_LIGHT_CTL_SERVER and @ref WICED_BT_MESH_MODEL_LIGHT_CTL_TEMPERATURE_SERVER
 * in two consecutive elements in the device definition. If the device supports several
 * lights with CTL Server, for example, a light fixture or a chandelier with several color
 * lights, the pair of @ref WICED_BT_MESH_MODEL_LIGHT_CTL_SERVER and @ref WICED_BT_MESH_MODEL_LIGHT_CTL_TEMPERATURE_SERVER
 * shall be repeated for each physical device.
 *
 * In addition to the definition, the application shall initialize the CTL Server module by calling
 * @ref wiced_bt_mesh_model_light_ctl_server_init function for each primary element where the CTL
 * functionality is required providing the @ref wiced_bt_mesh_light_ctl_server_callback_t
 * callback that will be executed when the brightness level or the color temperature of the device needs to be changed.
 *
 * If the brightness or color temperature of the device is changed locally the application should call the
 * @ref wiced_bt_mesh_model_light_ctl_status_changed so that the library can maintain correct state and
 * send an appropriate status message if it is configured to do so.
 *
 * Most of the functionality of the Light CTL server device is implemented in the Mesh Models Library. The
 * application only needs to set hardware appropriately on receiving @ref WICED_BT_MESH_LIGHT_CTL_SET event.
 * If client requests to change the brightness or the color temperature to the target value over a period of time,
 * the library will maintain the timer and will periodically call the application with appropriate values.
 *
 * The default transition time is managed by the Mesh Models library. The application provides factory default
 * in the default_transition_time element of the @ref wiced_bt_mesh_core_config_t configuration structure.
 * The default value is used unless overwritten by the default transition time client.
 *
 * The on power up behavior is managed by the Mesh Models library. The application provides factory default
 * in the onpowerup_state element of the @ref wiced_bt_mesh_core_config_t configuration structure.
 * The default value is used unless overwritten by the default transition time client.

 * (for example, by controlling PWM) to comply with the values requested by the library.
 *
 * If peer device requested to transition to the new brightness, x or y states over a period of time, the
 * callback will be executed repeatedly.  The Mesh Models Library calculates the present levels and submits to the
 * application to setup the hardware.
 *
 * The p_data parameter points to the @ref wiced_bt_mesh_light_xyl_status_data_t structure. Typically the application
 * will only need to use the value of the present lightness, x and y fields which specify the target
 * values that the device shall be set at present time. If the remaining_time field is not zero,
 * the transition to the new target levels is in progress and the Mesh Models Library will execute the callback at
